# WorkHorz-Server

A web-application-framework in modern C++ with an integrated bare-essentials webserver and a Python3 plugin ability. Works best for middle- to enterprise-sized websites that need top performance, high security, easy integration into existing OS and libraries and full control over their web-app. The Open-Source version is of course free of charge. Business users should consider the commercial license which frees them to share the source code.

These are the modules that are planned for the first phase. Depending on the input and experience with it these may change over time.
