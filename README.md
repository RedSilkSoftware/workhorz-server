Workhorse-Server
================

A web-application-framework in C++ with an integrated bare-essentials webserver and a Python plugin ability. Works best for middle- to enterprise-sized websites that need top performance, high security and full control. The Open-Source version is of course free of charge. Business users should consider the commercial license which frees them to share the source code.
